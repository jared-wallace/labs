Additioinal question:

i) (15%) In ATmega128, assume a 32-bit integer A is stored in r4-r7, and another 32-bit integer B is stored in r8-r11.
a) Make an AVR function that implements "C=A+B". The function stores the return in r12-r15.
b) Make an AVR program that implements "A+=B". The program shall call the function "C=A+B" for the computation.

ii) (15%) The MICAz mote has 4352-Byte data ram. Make an AVR function to clean the data memory. The function should complete the following steps.
a) Clean the SREG register
b) Set the stack pointer to the bottom of the data ram.
c) Clear the whole data ram to 0.
