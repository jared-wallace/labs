[a] LEDs are light emitting diodes that are the blinking or steady lights that can indicate anything from PowerON, to problems with the system, to remote-control signals, depending on how they are designed.

[b] LEDs are designed to emit visible or infrared (IR) light when forward biased in a circuit.

[a] Gates, along with the other electronic devices that can be located on a circuit, can be compacted to form a single chip, called an integrated circuit (IC).

[b] SSI (small scale integration) containing up to 100 electronic components per chip, MSI (medium scale integration) containing between 100-3,000 electronic components per chip, LSI (large scale integration) containing 3000 – 100,000 electronic components per chip, VLSI (very large scale integration) containing between 100,000 – 1,000,000 electronic components per chip, ULSI (ultra large scale integration) containing over 1,000,000 electronic components per chip.

Let's have a base (-50) for temperature and a base (8000) for resistance.

(a) The table stores 251 offset values for temperatures and 12000 offset values for resistance. So, at least 8 bits are needed for temperature and at least 14 bits are needed for resistance. So, at least 3 bytes are needed for each row.

(b) The total memory of the table is 3x251=753 Bytes.

(a) Let x be the input and y be the output of V_OA. Then, set R_GA = 2KΩ, V_Ref = +5V.

(b) According to Figure 1, G = 1 + 50 / R_GA = 26. Then, (y - V_Ref) = G * x. So, y = 5 + 26 * x.
