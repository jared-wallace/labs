Additioinal question:

i) (20%)
a) Draw the layout of data memory space in ATmega128 (i.e. general registers, io registers, data)
b) Find the memory address and the io address (if available) for the following special registers.
   * IO registers for port A: PORTA, DDRA, PINA
   * Stack pointer registers: SPH, SPL
   * Status register: SREG
   * MCU control register: MCUCR
   * Interrup control and status registers: EIMSK, EIFR
   * USART0 registers: UDR0, UCSR0A, UCSR0B, UCSR0C, UBRR0H, UBRR0L

ii) (15%) Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) is a technique to control energy consumption of a processor.
   It is based on the two equations below, where v is the volatage supplied to the processor, p is the power consumption, f is the scaled processor frequency. Assume C = 2.75 W/V2, F = 3.8GHz, and K = 1.563V

   p = C * v^2
   f = F * (1 - K/v)

   Assume the process can execute 1 instruction per 2 clocks. If a task needs to execute 1000 instructions. 

a) If v is 3V, what is p and f? What is the total energy consumed by the task?
b) If v is 2V, what is p and f? What is the total energy consumed by the task?

Note: the total consumed energy is the multiplication of p and the time for exeucting the task.
