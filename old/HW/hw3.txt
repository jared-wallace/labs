20. (10%) Give an example to show how the performance could be affected.

Addtional questions:

i) (15%) Assume a CPU has pins connected to a AD7304 chip. The CPU will send 0x7D to the channel C of the chip.
a) What is in the data frame, i.e. SA SI A1 A0 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0?
b) What is the timing diagram for this transmission?

ii) (15%) Assume two devices are using UART for communication. The sending device has a clock of 9600Hz, and sends data at 9600bps.
The receiving device has a clock of 200KHz, and uses a counter to generate a slower clock for receiving data. For example, the device lets the counter count from 0 to 9 periodically. Then, the device generates a clock of 20KHz.
Assume the counter must be a multiple of 16 due to the design inside the hardware. Hence, the receiving device can only generate a receiving clock close to 9600Hz.
a) Assume the receiving clock is faster than 9600Hz. What is the maximum frame size (including all start and stop bits)?
b) Assume the receiving clock is slower than 9600Hz. What is the maximum frame size (including all start and stop bits)?
