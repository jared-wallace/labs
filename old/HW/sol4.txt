[a] The features that are built into an architectureâ€™s instruction set are commonly referred
to as the Instruction Set Architecture(ISA).

[b] ISAs typically define such features as the operations that can be used by
programmers to create programs for that architecture, the operands [data] that are
accepted and processed by an architecture, operand storage, addressing modes used to
gain access to and process operands, and the handling of interrupts.

2. (15%)
[a] The most commonly implemented ISA models are application-specific (typically
define processors that are intended for specific embedded applications), general purpose
(typically implemented in processors that are targeted to be used in a wide variety of
embedded systems, rather than in specific types of embedded systems and only those
types of systems), and instruction-level parallel (similar to general-purpose ISAs, except
that they execute multiple instructions in parallel).

[b] application-specific : JVM (aj100,...), FSMD(ASICS, PLDs, ...), Datapath (DSPs,...)
general purpose : CISC (x86, 68K,...), RISC (PPC, MIPS,...)
instruction-level parallel : SIMD (oti4110,...), Superscaler(tricore), VLIW(TL1100,....)

The memory hierarchy is a collection of different types of memory, each with unique
speeds, sizes, and usages. Some of this memory can be physically integrated on the
processor, such as registers, Read-Only Memory (ROM), certain types of Random
Access Memory (RAM), and level-1 cache. While level-2+ cache, other types of main
and secondary memory are located on the board.

MMUs and memory controllers
