Discuss logistical details. Website(including links), email, office and hours,
    code submittal process

Mention style guide, stress that we will reinforce as we come across relevant
    elements

Cover attendance expectations, grading

Basic elements  of a program (hello world example), mention future labs in
    Linux

    Preprocessor directive(start with hash tag, no semicolon, prevents
        reinventing wheel)
    Using directive (why we use it globally, why bad practice)
    Main function
    Program terminator (<cstdlib>)

Work through hello world, including discussing the compilation process

Data types

primitive:
    int
        long, short, signed, unsigned
        guaranteed 16 bits, usually 32
        long guarantees 32
        short is 16 bits
        16 bit means -32,767 to 32,767 (65,535 unsigned)
        32 bit means -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647
    float
        IEEE 32 bit(7 digits more or less)
    double
        IEEE 64 bit(15 digits)
        (cover why float comparison bad)
    char
    bool
        true(1) or false(0)

string type
    must #include<string> (although some compilers will automatically do it)

Variables and literals, assignments:
    why variables
    how to assign value to variable

Expressions:
    computes value
    assigns value
    modifies value

Discuss standard header:
    name
    date
    lab number
