\section*{Overview}
Today we are going to practice using structs for fun and profit. We're
going to build an MP3 manager application (that actually plays mp3's!)
\section*{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (15 pts) Explain what a struct is and why it's useful. Two bonus points if
        you can explain what the main alternative to a struct is \emph{and} how
        it differs from a struct.
    \item (85 pts) Write an mp3 manager, starting with the supplied code, that
        adheres to the following specifications:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Declares a struct to hold the following information:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Song title
                \item Filename
                \item Genre
                \item Track number
            \end{itemize}
        \item Declares an array (or similar alternative) to handle storing the structs
        \item Provides options to enter a new song, delete an existing song, display
            all existing songs, and play a specific song (method of selecting is up to you;
            by name, track or any other struct field).
        \item Utilizes a nicely formatted menu driven interface
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Deliverables}
Hard copy of the source code you wrote (mp3.cpp). Soft copy (upload to homework upload) of
your source code. You may, at your discretion, use Git for version control -- it is not required.
