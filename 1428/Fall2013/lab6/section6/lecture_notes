When to use for loop
   when the number of times through the loop is both known and consistent
Basic structure
   declaring/initializing index variable
   setting limit (conditional)
   step (positive, negative, can be more than 1)
Common pitfalls
   never reaching the limit (infinite loop)
   off by one errors
To keep in mind
   take advantage of the loop indexes inside the loop
      (not just a way to mark time)
