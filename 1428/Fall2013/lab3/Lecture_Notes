Review previous week's program
   common mistakes (no () around 2a, subtraction not commutative
   emphasize reading directions carefully
File input/output
   first time we need to verify something (file opened successfully)
   using an if statement
   same basic syntax as cin/cout
Writing program in stages
   sample file already compiles
   do one section at a time
   TEST, TEST, TEST
