literals versus variables versus constants
	variable - memory address, value can change
	constant - memory address, value cannot change
	literal - no memory address, value is whatever it is
	string literal - "this is a string literal"
	review datatypes
common errors:
	typo
	forget the semicolon
	only declare once!
		review declaration/initialization/usage
debugging:
	what we do when original program has mistakes
		examine error messages
			missing semicolon before...
		*change ONE thing at a time*
		insert cout statements to examine variables
		use debugger (advanced)
	step through debugging program test.cpp
		namepspace std
		period instead of comma
		semicolon after cout
		area calculation is incorrect
Also:
	upload ONLY the program you write (not the debugged ones)
	correct naming of the file
	correct header
