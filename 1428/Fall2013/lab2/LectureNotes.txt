Review:
	proper header
	upload and proper naming
Console IO:
	cout(already seen) and cin
	direction of operators
	endl vs /n
		endl flushes the buffer immediately
		/n is faster (especially with file I/O)
Expression Evaluation:
	order of operations
Arithmetic Operators:
	usual plus modulus
Shorthand Operators:
	+=, *=, -=, /=, ++, --
	postfix/prefix increment/decrement
Using library functions:
	sqrt()
	if unsure, lookup
Reliable Sources:
	cplusplus.com
	stackoverflow.com
Verification/Testing:
	testing with known values
	edge cases
