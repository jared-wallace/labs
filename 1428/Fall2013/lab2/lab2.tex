	\section*{Part 1: Write a program}
	The quadratic formula is as follows:
	\begin{equation}
	\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{itemize}
			\item Prompt the user for the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ determine what possible solutions for x.  
				Note: you will need to calculate two (2) values because of the $\pm$.  
			\item You will need to use the \textbf{sqrt()} function which is available in the \textbf{\textless math.h\textgreater} library.  
			\item In the case where the values of $a$, $b$ and $c$ result in a negative under the root you should get \textbf{nan} as the result of your calculations.  This signifies \textbf{not a number} which occurs when you try to take the root of a negative, divide by zero or some other operation that is undefined in mathematics. To avoid complicating the assignment any further we will not check for \textbf{nan} and discard it, instead we will print it as if it is a valid answer and expect the hypothetical \emph{user} to know well enough to ignore it.
